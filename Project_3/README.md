## Abstract
Looking at how n-coupled differential equations can be solved numerically using the Velocity-Verlet and Forward Euler algorithms for systems governed by Newtonian gravity. Found that the Forward Euler method falls short compared to the Velocity-Verlet method as it is non-conservative and requires a greater number of integration points to converge in the given system. There was also an unsuccessful attempt at reproducing the perihelion precession of mercury using a modified model in a 2-body system.
