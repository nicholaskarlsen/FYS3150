# Project 2
## Abstract
  A look on the Jacobi Eigenvalue algorithm, and its application to a small selection of physical problems. Finding how the computation time of the algorithm develops by increasing the size of the problem, and how the implementation of the algorithm can make it more efficient. Found that the algorithm replicates analytical results to a reasonable degree of precision, and that it can be very easily applied to a large range of problems.
