  \subsection{The Ising Model}
    In its simplest case, a paramagnet is described as a lattice of noninteracting dipole moments, each in a state up or down. Where the energy of the system is proportional to the sum of the spins, up or down of each noninteracting constituent.

    The Ising model is a natural extension to this, by adding local interaction between directly neighboring spins (See fig. \ref{fig:spinsites}), such that the energy of the system is instead proportional to the sum of each spin coupled with its nearest neighbors, which gives a much more accurate description of the system compared to the simple case of an ideal paramagnet.

    Or more precisely, the energy is given by Eqn.~\ref{eqn:ising_energy}, where $s_i \in \{-1, 1\}$ and $J$ is a coupling constant.

    \begin{equation}
      E = -J\sum_{<kl>} s_ks_l
      \label{eqn:ising_energy}
    \end{equation}
    In this summation, the notation $<kl>$ means that for each $k$, we take the sum over each direct neighbor. However, in this project the lattice will be treated as pseudo-continuous where any spin-sites located at an edge, will also interact with the spin-site on the opposing edge, illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:ising_periodic bounds}, which strictly speaking constitutes having periodic boundary conditions.

    We also have the magnetization, $\mathcal M$, which is simply the sum of all spins
    \begin{equation*}
      \mathcal M = \sum_i s_i
    \end{equation*}

    \subsubsection{Boltzmann Statistics}
      From Eqn.~\ref{eqn:ising_energy} we can derive many thermodynamic quantities using Boltzmann statistics, where we have the probability of the system being in some specific macro-state\footnote{Macroscopic states being characterized by their energy, meaning i could just as well have written "... the probability of the system having some speciffic energy"}
      \begin{equation}
        \mathcal P(E_s) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\beta E_s}
      \end{equation}
      With $\beta \equiv \frac{1}{k_B T}$, the thermodynamic beta and $Z$, the partition function, acting as a normalization factor given by\footnote{Strictly speaking, this is the partition function for a system with discrete macro-states. In the continuous case, simply replace sums with integrals.}

      \begin{equation}
        Z = \sum_s e^{-\beta E_s}
      \end{equation}
      From this, the expectation value of some quantity $X$, with a set of known macrostates $X_s$ can be computed by

      \begin{equation}
        \left<X\right> = \sum_s X_s \mathcal P(E_s) = \frac{1}{Z} \sum_s X_s e^{-\beta E_s} 
      \end{equation}
      Using this, we can compute the specific heat capacity, $C_V$ by computing the expectation values of $E, E^2$ \cite{statmek_lecnotes}, related by the following expression

      \begin{equation}
        C_V = \frac{\left<E^2\right> - \left<E\right>^2}{k_B T^2}
      \end{equation}
      Where $\left<X^2\right> - \left<X\right>^2$ is recognized as the square of the standard deviation in the normal distribution, $\sigma_X^2$.

      In a similar fashion, the magnetic susceptibility, $\chi$, is calculated from $\sigma_\mathcal M ^2$ \cite{statmek_lecnotes}

      \begin{equation}
        \chi = \frac{\sigma^2_\mathcal M}{k_B T}
      \end{equation}

  \subsubsection{Analytic solution of 2x2 Lattice}
    Consider now a 2x2 lattice, each with spin $\pm 1$.
    The energy of the system for a particular micro-state is given by Eqn.~\ref{eqn:ising_energy}.
