## Abstract
  Using the Metropolis algorithm to study a system of coupled paramagnets, the Ising model. Derived exact solutions of expectation values for a 2 by 2 lattice and found the algorithm to make accurate predictions to the third decimal in $10^6$ Monte Carlo cycles. Further, looked at a 20 by 20 lattice and found a link between the equilibration time and the temperature of the system. Lastly, tried to observe the phase transition, and replicate the result produced by \textcite{PhysRev.65.117}, observed the expected behavior qualitatively, but failed to extract numbers.
