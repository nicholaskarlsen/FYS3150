# Project 5 - Disease Modeling
## Abstract
We developed a Monte Carlo (MC) method for simulating the SIRS model, and several extensions to it. The method was based on a sets of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODE) and we observe a mostly good correspondence between the two models, with the exception of a few boundary cases, where we see local peaks in the standard deviation of the MC simulations. When modeling the effects of vaccinations we see that the MC simulation is much more robust, and reflects reality in a better way than the differential equation from which it is based.
